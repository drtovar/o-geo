<p dir="auto"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>
Choose an image of a landscape that embodies some kind of utopian space, AKA an "other space" (to quote Foucault). This image can be a photograph or a video that you have taken; it can be a screen capture (either still or video) of an existing image or a virtual landscape. You can use or build off the image you chose for your first project -OR- you can choose a brand new image.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, <em>add</em> to this image at least one more image that undermines or somehow otherwise complicates the seemingly utopian vision of the first, revealing it to be ordinary, dangerous, repugnant, dystopian, etc. Life your first image, this can be a photo, a video, or a screencap. How you add this second visual element is up to you and it is here that you can assert a great amount of creativity. It can be side by side with the first image, or incorporated within it. </p>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: If you choose to make a video rather than an image, the camera should be more or less still and there should be no sound. The piece should primarily rely on the visual composition to create a narrative or tension that disrupts standard perception and provokes further thought. Videos should be no shorter than 1 minute and no longer than 4 minutes. See an example of such a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/kTvvrgy56NQ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/kTvvrgy56NQ" target="_blank">composition here.</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Have these questions in mind when constructing your composition:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">An image might <em>appear</em> to picture a place separate from daily life, but is it? </li>
<li dir="auto">What is required to maintain this (perhaps seemingly) outside place as an outside? (For instance, think police maintaining a perfectly landscaped park.</li>
<li dir="auto">Consider the the elements contained in the image of the utopian space that help contribute to its overall meaning as a utopian space. How might one or more of these elements be changed to alter the overall meaning of the image? (An example: a beautiful picture of the ocean relies on the purity of the water. The presence of trash, oil in the water, etc, might alter this.)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>WAYS OF PRODUCING THE DELIVERABLES FOR THIS PROJECT</strong></p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto">You can turn in a digital image, combining images using Adobe Photoshop or similar software. </li>
<li dir="auto">You can use a video program like Adobe Premiere to collage video. I've created a brief tutorial for how to do this <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/vH2qwzXOSsg" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/vH2qwzXOSsg" target="_blank">here.</a> Note that in this tutorial, I export as a 1080p video. You are free to export to higher resolutions (likely 4K) and/or different dimensions.</li>
<li dir="auto">You can also make a physical collage. (for instance rip down some <em>actual</em> signs, just like Mark Bradford, and tape them together; use a sign a paste your image(s) on top of it.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-heading="HOW TO SUBMIT" dir="auto">HOW TO SUBMIT</h2>
<p dir="auto">You project should be a single image or video file if turning in a visual file. If you are making a physical collage, please photograph it. Submit files to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.are.na/sci-arc-s25-outsider-geographies/project-2-hu2jjgona8k" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.are.na/sci-arc-s25-outsider-geographies/project-2-hu2jjgona8k" target="_blank">"Project 2" Are.na channel</a>. If your project is too large to upload to Are.na, please upload to your OneDrive account and post a link to the file on Aren.a.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Ideas for composing your collage</strong>: </p>
<p dir="auto">Side by side:<br>
<img width="600" alt="side b side 1.jpg" src="side b side 1.jpg" class="internal-embed"></p>
<p dir="auto">You can layer images:<br>
<img width="600" alt="layered.jpg" src="layered.jpg" class="internal-embed"></p>
<p dir="auto">You can have a collection of images:<br>
<img width="600" alt="series.jpg" src="series.jpg" class="internal-embed"><br>
Or whatever else you think up! Be creative.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Examples</strong><br>
The movies we watched in class offer examples of image sequences in which one undermines or complicates the ideas represented by the other. For example, in Meshes of the Afternoon, we see a hand holding a key in one frame; in the next frame, the same hand is instead holding a knife. The key can be seen to represent freedom, possibility, opportunity; the knife, conversely, represents danger, violence, destruction.  </p>
