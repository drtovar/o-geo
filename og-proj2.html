<p dir="auto"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>
Choose an image of a landscape that embodies a utopian space, AKA an "other space" (to quote Foucault). This might be a photograph or video that you have taken, or even a screen capture of an existing image or a virtual landscape. </p>
<p dir="auto">Then, <em>add</em> to this image at least one more image that undermines the seemingly utopian vision of the first, revealing it to be ordinary, dangerous, repugnant, or even dystopian. How you add this second visual element is up to you and it is here that you can assert a great amount of creativity. It can be side by side with the first image, or incorporated within it. </p>
<p dir="auto">If you choose to make a video rather than an image, the camera should be more or less still and there should be no sound. The piece should primarily rely on the visual composition to create a narrative or tension that disrupts standard perception and provokes further thought. </p>
<p dir="auto">Have these questions in mind when constructing your composition:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">An image might <em>appear</em> to picture a place separate from daily life, but is it? </li>
<li dir="auto">What is required to maintain this (perhaps seemingly) outside place as an outside? (For instance, think police maintaining a perfectly landscaped park.</li>
<li dir="auto">Consider the the elements contained in the image of the utopian space that help contribute to its overall meaning as a utopian space. How might one or more of these elements be changed to alter the overall meaning of the image? (An example: a beautiful picture of the ocean relies on the purity of the water. The presence of trash, oil in the water, etc, might alter this.)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>HOW TO SUBMIT</strong><br>
You project should be a single image or video file. Please upload this to the "Week 03: Stalker" Are.na channel. If your project is too large to upload to Are.na, please upload to your OneDrive account and post a link to the file on Aren.a.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Possible ways of creating multi-image compositions</strong>:<br>
<img width="600" alt="side b side 1.jpg" src="side b side 1.jpg" class="internal-embed"></p>
<p dir="auto">You can layer images:<br>
<img width="600" alt="layered.jpg" src="layered.jpg" class="internal-embed"></p>
<p dir="auto">You can have a collection of images:<br>
<img width="600" alt="series.jpg" src="series.jpg" class="internal-embed"></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Examples</strong><br>
The movies we watched in class last Thursday offer examples of image sequences in which one undermines the ideas represented by the other. For example, in Meshes of the Afternoon, we see a hand holding a key in one frame; in the next frame, the same hand is instead holding a knife. The key can be seen to represent freedom, possibility, opportunity; the knife, conversely, represents danger, violence, destruction.  </p>
