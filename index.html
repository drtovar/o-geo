<p dir="auto">Syllabus<br>
LA TK: Outsider Geographies<br>
SCI-Arc: Spring 2025<br>
Instructor: Daniel Tovar<br>
TA: Solomon<br>
Time:1–3:50<br>
Room: 226</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>COURSE ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">From the hinterlands to the wilderness to outer space, the notion of an other space has loomed large in the popular geographic imaginary. It promises freedom and salvation, and also danger and damnation. But what has led us to so consistently divide the landscape into inner and outer? Why do we so fervently long for another world, life, and body? And why have we so often insisted that it must be found out there — in the forest, the desert, on Mars?</p>
<p dir="auto">In this course, we will survey these outsider geographies and their depictions in film, photography, sound, and sculpture. Students will think about how these outsider geographies can inform their own representations of the landscape – and also how to subvert them. Students will embark on projects that visually and sonically represent the landscape while also sharpening their representations through writing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>COURSE DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This course has two aims. First, it aims to give a multi-disciplinary survey of media that imagine "outsider" geographies. Its second aim is to help students develop a practice that incorporates theory. It is an exercise in using theory to push forward artistic projects and artistic projects to help push forward understanding of theory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>COURSE ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The practical topics mentioned above — visual, aural, and writing — will organize the broad structure of the course. On a more granular level, each class will be organized around different topic and corresponding text(s). </p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>MATERIAL NEEDS</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">We will have a field trip just after studio midterms. I will be renting an Air BNB that we can all pitch in on. More on this when we (hopefully) meet in person in Week 2.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Student Learning Objective 1: The course will familiarize students with the concept of utopia and related concepts across disciplines.</li>
<li dir="auto">Student Learning Outcome 1: Students will come away with an understanding of how the concept of utopia has influenced our thinking about the landscape and our relationship the landscape in a number of disciplines including philosophy, literature, history, art, and architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PROJECTS OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">There are four projects in this course each of which can be divided into the following three categories: visual, sound, text. Project 1 and 2 are visual. Project 3 will focus on sound. Project 4 will focus on text.</p>
<p dir="auto">The skills developed in each project build on each other.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Photography, sound and video recording, and theory combined into a unified practice.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>COMPONENTS OF GRADING</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Participation: 52%<br>
Project 1:     12%<br>
Project 2:     12%<br>
Project 3:     12%<br>
Project 4:     12%</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>GRADING PROCEDURES</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Grades will be determined based upon the meeting of student learning objectives, quality of work produced, improvement over the course of the semester, completion of project requirements, quality of participation, attendance, attitude, and ethical conduct. SCI-Arc grading policies will be discussed on the first day of class, and any questions regarding grades or policies should be directed to the instructor and/or Lisa Russo, the registrar. A passing grade in the course requires committed completion of all projects. Incomplete work will not be evaluated.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>From the SCI-Arc Student Handbook__:</em> SCI-Arc employs a narrative grading system, as follows: credit with distinction (CR+), credit (CR), marginal credit (CR-), conditional credit (CCR), no credit (NC), incomplete (I) and withdrawal (W). The grade of no credit (NC) is given whenever cumulative work, final work, and/or attendance are unsatisfactory. It is also given when a student fails to submit a final project or fails to take a final examination without prior approval from the instructor. No credit (NC) grades cannot be altered.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY</strong> <em>(from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">SCI-Arc takes issues of academic integrity seriously, including plagiarism, which can occur in design classes as well as core and elective classes. Some examples of plagiarism include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Copying words, images, or other material without using quotation marks or other indications of the original source.</li>
<li dir="auto">Paraphrasing another person’s ideas in your own words without crediting the original source.</li>
<li dir="auto">Taking sole credit for assignments without giving credit to those who worked with you.</li>
<li dir="auto">Submitting work for a course that has already/also been submitted for another course.</li>
<li dir="auto">Internet plagiarism, such as submitting work either found or paid for online, failing to cite any internet sources used, or cutting and pasting sentences from various websites to create a collage of uncited words.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note: the academic integrity policy contains several tiers, depending on the nature and extent of academic dishonesty involved and on whether the student has committed an academic offense before. All cases <em>must</em> be reported to the Academic Advisor and the report is added to the student’s academic record. Refer to the SCI-Arc Student Handbook for the full academic integrity policy including what happens at various tiers, right of appeal, and possible disciplinary outcomes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>ATTENDANCE POLICY</strong> <em>(from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Any student who is absent without an acceptable excuse more than three times during a fifteen-week term will receive a grade of no credit (NC) for the course. Instructors may impose more stringent attendance requirements and should make them clear at the beginning of the term. It is legitimate for the instructor to view unexcused lateness or departures from class as full absences.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto">Examples of acceptable excused absences are the following: medical/illness, observance of religious holiday, emergency leave, bereavement due to death in immediate family, military duty, jury duty, involvement in traffic accident, and court appearance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>INCOMPLETE WORK</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">A student may receive a grade of incomplete (I) by requesting permission from the instructor prior to the date of the final examination or presentation. Permission will be granted only under extraordinary circumstances and usually for medical reasons. Incompletes must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of the instructor no later than three (3) weeks after the end of term. The student is responsible for providing the instructor with the “Request for Credit” card used for this purpose. This card must be signed by the instructor and returned to the Registrar’s office. Failure to do so will result in the incomplete (I) being changed to a no credit (NC). No credit grades cannot be altered.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>APPEAL OF A GRADE</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Evaluation and grading of a student’s performance in a course is based upon the instructor’s professional assessment of the academic quality of the student’s performance on a body of work. Such assessments are nonnegotiable, and disputes about them do not constitute valid grounds for an appeal. Students are encouraged to contact their instructor for clarification regarding the grade received in their course.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto">Grade appeals are rare and subject to appeal only for the following three grounds:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">improper academic procedures that unfairly affect a student’s grade.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="auto">application of nonacademic criteria, such as: considerations of race, politics, religion, sex, or other criteria not directly reflective of performance related to course requirements.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="auto">sexual harassment.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Students must meet with the Academic Advisor to review the appeal process if they believe the grade received meets one or more of the grounds listed above. Petitions must be settled, and a final grade submitted to the registrar no later than six weeks after the end of the term in which the course was completed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>ARCHIVING</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The SCI-Arc Upload site is the school’s official archive of each semester’s work. This is a mandatory requirement of each student’s coursework, and grades will not be submitted until work is uploaded. This archive will be used for all future publications and graphic material as well as for required accreditation needs of SCI-Arc. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto">Archiving requirements may vary based on curricular and/or project requirements. Specific instructions will be communicated to students each semester.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OWNERSHIP OF WORK</strong> (<em>from SCI-Arc Student Handbook</em>)</p>
<p dir="auto">Physical copies of student work submitted to the school to satisfy course requirements including but not limited to digital files, papers, drawings, and models become the property of the school. SCI-Arc shall have no obligation to safeguard such materials and may, at its discretion, retain them, return them to the student, or discard them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notwithstanding whether it retains any physical copies of such student works, SCI-Arc shall have an irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right in perpetuity to use, reproduce, display, and exhibit works created by students during their studies at SCI-Arc, in publications by or about SCI-Arc, on its websites, on social media, or otherwise. SCI-Arc will make a reasonable effort to credit the author(s) of student work included in publications or other uses. Excepting works which are created during a student’s participation in a Sponsored Project, the student shall have the right to publish or present their own work without compensation to SCIArc. However, SCI-Arc must be informed of this publication and appropriately credited in this publication or presentation unless SCI-Arc requests not to be credited.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>SUPPORTING MENTAL HEALTH</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, or problems with eating or sleeping can interfere with optimal academic performance. Reducing stigma about accessing mental health care supports students seeking professional help when it is needed. SCI-Arc provides all students with two free counseling sessions per year. Sessions are available two days per week throughout the fall and spring terms, and one day per week during the summer term. All counseling sessions are confidential. Only with your consent can any details of your session be shared with another individual. Information to schedule an appointment can be found on the Campus Life tab of MySciarc.</p><br>
