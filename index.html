Syllabus
LA 8039: Outsider Geographies
SCI-Arc: Spring 2025

Instructor: Daniel Tovar (contact via Teams)
TA: Salomon Cordova (contact via Teams)
Time:1â€“3:50
Room: 226

**COURSE ABSTRACT**

From the hinterlands to the wilderness to outer space, the notion of
an other space has loomed large in the popular geographic imaginary.
It promises freedom and salvation, and also danger and damnation. But
what has led us to so consistently divide the landscape into inner and
outer? Why do we so fervently long for another world, life, and body?
And why have we so often insisted that it must be found out there ---
in the forest, the desert, on Mars?

In this course, we will survey these outsider geographies and their
depictions in film, photography, sound, and sculpture. Students will
think about how these outsider geographies can inform their own
representations of the landscape -- and also how to subvert them.
Students will embark on projects that visually and sonically represent
the landscape while also sharpening their representations through
writing.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course has two aims. First, it aims to give a multi-disciplinary
survey of media that imagine and conceptualize what I am calling
"outsider geographies." Its second aim is to help students develop a
practice that incorporates theory. It is an exercise in using theory to
push forward artistic projects and artistic projects to help push
forward a unique understanding of theory.

**COURSE ORGANIZATION**

The practical topics mentioned above --- visual, aural, and writing
--- will organize the broad structure of the course. On a more
granular level, each class will be organized around different topic
and corresponding text(s). See the course schedule below for a list of
weekly topics and the tri-partite division of the class.

**MATERIAL NEEDS**

We will have a field trip just after studio midterms. I will be
renting an Air BNB that we can all pitch in on. More on this when we
(hopefully) meet in person in Week 2.

**STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES**

-   Student Learning Objective 1: The course will familiarize
    students with the concept of utopia and related concepts across
    disciplines.

-   Student Learning Outcome 1: Students will come away with an
    understanding of how the concept of utopia has influenced our
    thinking about the landscape and our relationship the landscape in a 
    number of disciplines including philosophy, literature, history, art, 
    and architecture.

**PROJECTS OVERVIEW**

There are four projects in this course each of which can be divided
into the following three categories: visual, sound, text. Project 1
and 2 are visual. Project 3 will focus on sound. Project 4 will focus
on text.

The skills developed in each project build on each other.

**TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES**

Photography, sound and video recording, and theory combined into a
unified practice.

**GRADING PROCEDURES**

Grades will be determined based upon the meeting of student learning
objectives, quality of work produced, improvement over the course of
the semester, completion of project requirements, quality of
participation, attendance, attitude, and ethical conduct. SCI-Arc
grading policies will be discussed on the first day of class, and any
questions regarding grades or policies should be directed to the
instructor and/or Lisa Russo, the registrar. A passing grade in the
course requires committed completion of all projects. Incomplete work
will not be evaluated.Â 

*From the SCI-Arc Student Handbook:* SCI-Arc employs a narrative
grading system, as follows: credit with distinction (CR+), credit
(CR), marginal credit (CR-), conditional credit (CCR), no credit (NC),
incomplete (I) and withdrawal (W). The grade of no credit (NC) is
given whenever cumulative work, final work, and/or attendance are
unsatisfactory. It is also given when a student fails to submit a
final project or fails to take a final examination without prior
approval from the instructor. No credit (NC) grades cannot be altered.

*GPA Equivalents:*

  Grade   Point Equivalent
  ------- ------------------
  CR+     4.0
  CR      3.35
  CR-     2.7
  CCR     2.0
  NC      0.0
  I       0.0
  W       0.0

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY** *(from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)*

SCI-Arc takes issues of academic integrity seriously, including
plagiarism, which can occur in design classes as well as core and
elective classes. Some examples of plagiarism include:

-   Copying words, images, or other material without using quotation
    marks or other indications of the original source.
-   Paraphrasing another person's ideas in your own words without
    crediting the original source.
-   Taking sole credit for assignments without giving credit to those
    who worked with you.
-   Submitting work for a course that has already/also been submitted
    for another course.
-   Internet plagiarism, such as submitting work either found or paid
    for online, failing to cite any internet sources used, or cutting
    and pasting sentences from various websites to create a collage of
    uncited words.

Note: the academic integrity policy contains several tiers, depending
on the nature and extent of academic dishonesty involved and on
whether the student has committed an academic offense before. All
cases *must* be reported to the Academic Advisor and the report is
added to the student's academic record. Refer to the SCI-Arc Student
Handbook for the full academic integrity policy including what happens
at various tiers, right of appeal, and possible disciplinary outcomes.

**ATTENDANCE POLICY** *(from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)*

Any student who is absent without an acceptable excuse more than three
times during a fifteen-week term will receive a grade of no credit
(NC) for the course. Instructors may impose more stringent attendance
requirements and should make them clear at the beginning of the term.
It is legitimate for the instructor to view unexcused lateness or
departures from class as full absences.Â 

Examples of acceptable excused absences are the following:
medical/illness, observance of religious holiday, emergency leave,
bereavement due to death in immediate family, military duty, jury
duty, involvement in traffic accident, and court appearance.

**INCOMPLETE WORK**

A student may receive a grade of incomplete (I) by requesting
permission from the instructor prior to the date of the final
examination or presentation. Permission will be granted only under
extraordinary circumstances and usually for medical reasons.
Incompletes must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of the instructor no
later than three (3) weeks after the end of term. The student is
responsible for providing the instructor with the "Request for Credit"
card used for this purpose. This card must be signed by the instructor
and returned to the Registrar's office. Failure to do so will result
in the incomplete (I) being changed to a no credit (NC). No credit
grades cannot be altered.

**APPEAL OF A GRADE**

Evaluation and grading of a student's performance in a course is based
upon the instructor's professional assessment of the academic quality
of the student's performance on a body of work. Such assessments are
nonnegotiable, and disputes about them do not constitute valid grounds
for an appeal. Students are encouraged to contact their instructor for
clarification regarding the grade received in their course.Â 

Grade appeals are rare and subject to appeal only for the following
three grounds:Â 

-   improper academic procedures that unfairly affect a student's
    grade.Â 
-   application of nonacademic criteria, such as: considerations of
    race, politics, religion, sex, or other criteria not directly
    reflective of performance related to course requirements.Â 
-   sexual harassment.

Students must meet with the Academic Advisor to review the appeal
process if they believe the grade received meets one or more of the
grounds listed above. Petitions must be settled, and a final grade
submitted to the registrar no later than six weeks after the end of
the term in which the course was completed.

**ARCHIVING**

The SCI-Arc Upload site is the school's official archive of each
semester's work. This is a mandatory requirement of each student's
coursework, and grades will not be submitted until work is uploaded.
This archive will be used for all future publications and graphic
material as well as for required accreditation needs of SCI-Arc. Â 

Archiving requirements may vary based on curricular and/or project
requirements. Specific instructions will be communicated to students
each semester.

**OWNERSHIP OF WORK** (*from SCI-Arc Student Handbook*)

Physical copies of student work submitted to the school to satisfy
course requirements including but not limited to digital files,
papers, drawings, and models become the property of the school.
SCI-Arc shall have no obligation to safeguard such materials and may,
at its discretion, retain them, return them to the student, or discard
them.

Notwithstanding whether it retains any physical copies of such student
works, SCI-Arc shall have an irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide
right in perpetuity to use, reproduce, display, and exhibit works
created by students during their studies at SCI-Arc, in publications
by or about SCI-Arc, on its websites, on social media, or otherwise.
SCI-Arc will make a reasonable effort to credit the author(s) of
student work included in publications or other uses. Excepting works
which are created during a student's participation in a Sponsored
Project, the student shall have the right to publish or present their
own work without compensation to SCIArc. However, SCI-Arc must be
informed of this publication and appropriately credited in this
publication or presentation unless SCI-Arc requests not to be
credited.

**SUPPORTING MENTAL HEALTH**

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes,
excessive worry, or problems with eating or sleeping can interfere
with optimal academic performance. Reducing stigma about accessing
mental health care supports students seeking professional help when it
is needed. SCI-Arc provides all students with two free counseling
sessions per year. Sessions are available two days per week throughout
the fall and spring terms, and one day per week during the summer
term. All counseling sessions are confidential. Only with your consent
can any details of your session be shared with another individual.
Information to schedule an appointment can be found on the Campus Life
tab of MySciarc.
